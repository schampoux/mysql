A query block, sometimes known also as a simple table, is any sql statement that returns a result set, such as SELECT. 

SQL works like this: 
    - FROM: choose your table 
    - WHERE: Filter the rows (optional)
    - GROUP BY: split the remaining rows into groups 
        - break all the rows into little buckets where every bucket has the same col1 and col2 values. 
        - then for each bucket, you get one result row.
    - AGGREGATE: For each group, compute something like COUNT(), SUM(), etc. 
    - SELECT: Pick what info to show per group. 
    - ORDER BY: Sort the results (optional) 
    

Example: 
    > SELECT col_1, COUNT(*) FROM TableName;

    What should col_1 show in the result row? 
        - its safe to assume that there are several different values in col_1
        - SQL would like to know what values you would like to count from col_1
