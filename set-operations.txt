* SQL Set Operations combine the results of multiple query blocks into a single result. 

The SQL standard defines the following three set operations:
    - UNION: Combine all results from two query blocks into a single result, omitting any duplicates.
    - INTERSECT: Combine only those rows which the results of two query blocks have in common, omitting any duplicates. 
    - EXCEPT: For two query blocks, A and B, return all result from A which are not also present in B, omitting any duplicates. 

- Each of these supports the ALL modifier. When the ALL keyword follows a set operator, this causes duplicated to be included inthe result. 

- All three set operators also support a DISTINCT keyword, which suppresses duplicates in the result. 
    - This is the default behavior, so its not necessary. 

* Syntax: 
    > query_block [set_operator query_block] [set_operator query_block] ...

  query_block:
    SELECT | TABLE | VALUES

  set_operator:
    UNION | INTERSECT | EXCEPT
