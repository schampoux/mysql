Where can you use aggregation functions? 
    - 

Where can't you use them? 
    - In a WHERE clause (that is, before the data is grouped)

Aggregation functions can summarize multiple rows into a single value. 
    - Hence aggregating them. 

GROUP BY 
    - tells the database to perform the aggregation for the column specified. 


MAX()

	- Find the highest known value in a numeric, date or string column. 
	- When applied to a column of numbers, MAX() returns the largest number in that column. 
	- When applied to a string, it will return the string that is last alphabetically. 
	- When using GROUP BY, it returns the highest balue within each group.
	- Since NULL is an unknown value, and MAX() only deals with known values, it ignores them. 
	
	Example: 
		SELECT MAX(price) FROM products;
		# returns the highest value in the price column of the products table. 
	
MIN() 
    - aggregation function.
