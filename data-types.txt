CHAR
	uses a fixed length 


VARCHAR(255) 
	only uses as much space as needed for the actual string.
	plus one or two extra bytes for storage.
	You must specify a max length when using varchar
		This means it can store up to (255) characters.

		the value in the foreign key column must exist in the referenced table.

	REFERENCES is used when defining a foreign key. It links a column to another tables column. 
	
	Ex. 
	> FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES referenced_table(referenced_column)
