LEAD(column1)
    
    - give me the column1 value from the next row

OVER(order by ...)
    
    - tells mysql how to find the next row. 
    - Example: 
            > OVER(ORDER BY temp desc)
   









example: 

So we want to make some new columns in the result set. 
we need: 
    - tomorrows_temp
    - todays_temp 
    - temp_difference 
    
How do we get tomorrows temp?
    > lead(temperature) over (order by recordDate) as tomorrows_temp xc

How do we get todays temp?     
    we already have it 
    > temperature as todays temp 

How do we get temp difference? 
    - lead(temperature) over (order by recordDate) - todays_temp as temp_difference
